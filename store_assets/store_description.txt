TAB GROUPS & WINDOWS LIST

A clean, 3-level expandable hierarchy of Windows, Tab Groups, and Tabs.

Are you a power user who relies on Chrome's Tab Groups to stay organized? Tab Groups & Windows List gives you an instant, bird's-eye view of everything happening across all your browser windows in one compact popup.

KEY FEATURES

3-Level Hierarchy: Windows at the top, Tab Groups nested inside, and individual Tabs at the bottom. Expand or collapse any level with a click.

Custom Window Names: Install the optional native helper to display real window titles from your OS instead of generic IDs.

Window Sorting: Sort your windows by Default order, A-Z alphabetically, or by Most Recently focused.

Click to Navigate: Click a window header to focus it, click a group to jump to its first tab, or click any tab to switch directly to it.

Color-Coded Groups: Group colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Pink, Purple, Cyan, Orange) are displayed with matching dots for instant recognition.

Live Updates: The popup refreshes automatically as you open, close, move, or rearrange tabs, groups, and windows. No manual refresh needed.

Ungrouped Tabs: Tabs that are not in any group are shown at the correct position within their window, so you always see the full picture.

Lightweight and Fast: No background overhead when the popup is closed, no tracking, and zero impact on browser performance.

Privacy Focused: Requires only the minimum necessary permissions to function. Your data stays local and is never sent to any remote server.

WHY USE THIS EXTENSION?

When you have dozens of tabs spread across multiple windows, finding a specific group or tab can be a challenge. This extension eliminates the guesswork by providing a centralized directory of every window, group, and tab. Whether you are managing work projects, research, or personal browsing, you can locate anything in seconds.

HOW IT WORKS

Click the extension icon in your toolbar.

See all your windows listed, each showing its custom name or a summary of its tab titles.

Expand a window to see its tab groups (with color dots) and ungrouped tabs in the correct order.

Expand a group to see individual tabs with their favicons.

Click any item to navigate directly to it.

OPTIONAL: CUSTOM WINDOW NAMES

By default, windows are labeled with a summary of their tab titles. For a better experience, you can install the optional native messaging host, a small Python script that reads your actual OS window titles (e.g. the names you set in your window manager). This works on macOS and Linux with Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, and Chromium.

The native host is a single Python script that runs locally on your machine. It only reads window titles and never contacts any remote server. It requires Python 3 and supports macOS and Linux.

Install instructions and source code are available on the project GitHub page:

Restart your browser after installing for the native host to take effect.

PERMISSIONS NOTE

This extension uses the tabGroups, windows, nativeMessaging, and storage permissions. The tabGroups and windows permissions are used to read your open windows and tab groups for display. The storage permission saves your sort preference. The nativeMessaging permission enables optional communication with a user-installed local helper that reads OS window titles. No data is sent to any remote server.
